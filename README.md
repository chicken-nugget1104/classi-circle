# mc-161807 (Pre-Classic)
Development phase: May 16, 2009 (until 18:07 UTC+2)

## Unofficial name
While this version is known to exist it is missing from the launcher and has not been archived elsewhere, meaning that it is currently lost.<br>
<br>
The version name is taken from [Notchs IRC message](https://archive.org/download/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009/history/files/May-15-to-June-03-2009/2009-05-16.075419-0400EDT.txt.~1~) <br>
`` (12:07:06) notch: minecraft alpha is available. I need someone on windows, someone on mac and someone on linux!``
<br>
<br>
Minecraft Wiki uses ``mc-161607`` for this version because it's in UTC format.
``mc-161807`` would be in UTC+2 (Timezone in Sweden)

## Changes
- Renamed com.mojang.rubydung to com.mojang.minecraft
- Added Applet to run the game

## Accuracy
This version has only been sent to [dock](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hayden_Scott-Baron) and [fartron](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?action=profile;u=61) for testing.
There is no existing backup.
We can assume that all necessary changes have been made in this update for the first release.
